        <h1 class="page-header">10 Tips for Surviving Graduate School</h1>
        
        <h2>Tip 1: Stop Procrastinating</h2>
        <div class="col-md-3">
                    <img src="img/procrastination.jpg" height="300" width="300" class="thumbnail">

                </div>
        <p>Never wait until the last minute.  Deadlines don't wait for the moment when you decide to get your act together.  I had a friend in undergrad that I admired for her time management skills.  She told me once that being tired results in tired work.  Her name was Emily.  Emily would go to sleep whenever she was tired instead of staying up all night and would wake up early in the morning to complete the task while she was alert and rested. Tweaking out from all the caffeine intake at a library lit by flourescent lighting is not the way to success.  Another reason to avoid procrastination is to avoid stress which will become your every day companion in graduate school.  When you finish work with a reasonable amount of time between completion and the deadline, you have a chance to look it over, make final edits and hand in a shining piece of wonderful writing.</p>
        
        <h2>Tip 2: Give Yourself a Study Break</h2>
        <div class="col-md-3">
                    <img src="img/pizza.jpg" height="300" width="300" class="thumbnail">

                </div>
        <p>I love feeling completely burnt out said no one ever.  In addition to making sure you have time to get your major projects done before deadline, it is important in graduate school for a gal to give herself from "me time."  This could include exercising, taking a walk, playing fetch with your dog at the dog park, getting your nails done, reading a non-school-related book.  When you make time for yourself every day, the stress of graduate school seems managable.  I recommend using a "study break" as a reward.  Studies show that working for roughly 30 to 45 minutes with 15 minute breaks between ends up in higher rates of production because the mind is trained to function on a reward system basis.  Knowing there is a miniture end in sight can help push through the tough tasks.</p>
        <h2>Tip 3: Remember That You Are an Intelligent, Independent Woman</h2>
        <p>The best example I can provide for you graduate ladies is this interview with my friend Kara Hartford who spends her summers as a white water rafting instructor.  When I asked her how she dealt with those pesky, macho men that believed her to be incompetent simply because she was a female in a predominantly male environment, she gave me a good tip: You are in charge and you are there for the safety of other rafters so there is no room for allowing that kind of biased thinking.  The same goes for graduate school when it's getting you down... Just repeat the mantra: I am an intelligent, independent woman.</p>

        <h2>Tip 4: Sacrifice a Bit of Your Social Life</h2>
        <div class="col-md-3">
                    <img src="img/social.jpg" height="300" width="300" class="thumbnail">

                </div>
        <p>Just as any former university co-ed, I have fond memories of tailgating, football games, drinking a ton of beer and then ordering 2 a.m. pizzas.  While yes, those undergraduate years were fun and yes, you did manage to earn an undergraduate degree in spite of the party atmosphere surrounding the said degree, graduate school is different.  A female graduate student's body is tired... Her brain is constantly engaged with new material, a thesis is looming, her boyfriend thinks so a lunatic and she is constantly on the edge of breaking down in pathetic tears.  It is important to remember that a graduate degree is more challenging and more professionally-oriented than an undergraduate degree.  You can still have your friends and go to the occasional party but just know that whatever you spend your time doing that isn't your schoolwork is hendering the process and a hendered process can often lead to a hurting bank account.  Be wise about how you spend your time outside of school.</p>
        <h2> Tip 5: Make a Friend in Each Class</h2>
        <div class="col-md-3">
                    <img src="img/friend.jpg" height="300" width="300" class="thumbnail">

                </div>
        <p>As I explained before, graduate school is more professionally-oriented than undergrad.  This means that a lot of graduate school is spent in discussion with peers and colleagues or collaborating on group projects.  Here is not the place to make enemies but to continue to make friends and connections with the people you're getting your degree with.  Just remember that these people are going to be your future colleagues in the career fields and may, in the long run, end up being valuable resources outside of the program as well as inside of the program.  I met my friend Kaitlyn in my first semester of graduate school.  We help each other out when we struggle to complete papers and projects but we also seek each other out for comfort in tough times and in stressful time.  Human beings are social beings and it is important to have a trustworthy and understanding person to touch base with on the daily.</p>
        <h2>Tip 6: Continue to Maintain a Positive Attitude</h2>
        <div class="col-md-3">
                    <img src="img/positive.jpg" height="300" width="300" class="thumbnail">

                </div>
        <p>Positive people feel less stressed and more confident, right?  Without a positive attitude, no one would obtain a graduate degree.  Graduate school tests your limits in ways that they haven't been tested before.  Not only are there classes and grades to worry about, but you have a constant giant task looming above you in form of a thesis or a project or a capstone class.  With the extra stress in addition to average stresses of everyday including relationships, roommates, finding a real job to support and feed yourself, a girl can often feel overwhelmed.  Without a positive attitude to keep yourself in check, your grades could suffer and; therefore, more stress heaps itself onto your plate.  According to a Johns Hopkins University study, stress can trigger a fight or flight reaction.  In the case of graduate school, a flight reaction is equated with giving up.  In order to avoid flunking out of school, one most maintain a positive attitude to get oneself through it.</p>
        <h2>Tip 7: Maintain a Healthy Diet</h2>
        <div class="col-md-3">
                    <img src="img/diet.jpg" height="300" width="300" class="thumbnail">

                </div>
        <p>It does not take a rocket scientist (or a doctoral candidate) to recognize the benefits of a healthy diet.  Filling your body with greasy, fast food may give the instant gratification our society so loves in that it satisfies hunger quickly but it doesn't help your body function at its peak performance.  This idea of "peak performance" doesn't just refer to running a marathon or becoming the next Michael Phelps but also in making sure your brain and body can perform well on tests and thinking critically.  Just as we learned so well in elementary school that eating breakfast is the most important part of your day, we should know as graduate students that clean-eating leads to healthier habits and maintaining a routine that is crucial to regulating your body.  This leads back to Tip 4 which warns against too much partying.  It takes a body longer to recover from a social event involving keg stands than a social event involving a bike ride through the park.</p>
        <h2>Tip 8: Let Yourself Cry</h2>
        <div class="col-md-3">
                    <img src="gif/meangirls.gif" height="300" width="300" class="thumbnail">

                </div>
        <p>I'm not saying you should carry a box of Kleenex under your arm like Linus's blanket, but I will say that it is important to let yourself break down every now and again.  According to Psychology Today, tears provide relief from stress, anxiety, sadness, frustration and grief.  Hormones which accumulate through stressful experience find escape through tear ducts.  By cleansing oneself of emotion through crying, human beings prevent said emotions from coming out in side effects of lack of release including fatigue or pain.  Because graduate students often stay up late working on material for classes, fatigue is often a mortal enemy.  I once read a blog from a fellow graduate student that was addressing other graduate students about what was "normal" in graduate school such as questioning is getting a graduate degree is a wise decision or crying all the time.  Crying is not a sign of weakness but rather a sign of courage because, when we cry, we know it doesn't necessarily take us out of our current situations but gives us the strength afterward to pick up and carry on with whatever you are doing.</p>
        <h2>Tip 9: Meet with an Adviser Frequently</h2>
        <div class="col-md-3">
                    <img src="img/adviser.jpeg" height="300" width="300" class="thumbnail">
            <p>Courtesy of scienceblogs.com</p>

                </div>
        <p>The first goal in graduate school for any graduate student should be to make an appointment with an adviser.  In my experience in graduate school, you have an initial adviser at first to help you get started but should move on to another adviser who will guide you throughout your thesis or project so that it may be successful.  Even once you have an adviser, the visits should be continually frequent so that your process is easily kept on track.  Every time you need to register for classes, even if you have a course plan, you should visit an adviser and make sure your decisions are wise and lead to obtaining your degree within an acceptable amount of time.  Also, advisers are professors that have already made the same journey that you are currently making.  Advice is extremely valuable in graduate school not only through your peers but also your professors.  Without checking in with an adviser, you could damage your own ability to graduate simply by not knowing as clearly where you need to be to become successful.</p>
        <h2>Tip 10: Just Do It</h2>
        <div class="col-md-3">

                </div>
        <p>The best piece of advice I received as an undergraduate was this: When you have a difficult task that is obsessing your mind, don't complain, don't procrastinate, just do it.  The famous brand of sneakers, Nike, adopts this slogan to apply to athletes and meeting their goals to be competitive at their sport.  I am a huge fan of sports analogy so I will give you this one.  Being a graduate student is like being an athlete.  You have to work at it a little bit every day, focusing on the set of skills that will best help to get you through and honing those skills with each project or paper you turn in.  An athlete must practice every day to prevent themselves from falling behind on their training.  Graduate students are no different.  A thesis needs work each day to make it happen.  Also, athletes don't let failure drive them into the ground but rather use failure as a platform and starting point to work up from.  That's why swimmers are constantly striving to get faster and baseball hitters are constantly trying to improve their batting averages.  If a graduate student let one setback stop them, they probably wouldn't make it out of their first semester.</p>
