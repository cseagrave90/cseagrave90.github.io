            <h2>My Research</h2>
<p>Because of the increasing popularity of online social media and a continuously polarized political landscape, this study intends to investigate bias in blogs with a focus on the media recipients consuming the material.</p>  
            <p>The focus of my research concerns media recipient awareness of bias in blogs or journalism blogs commonly dubbed "j-blogs."  In a media society that has changed so drastically in the last few decades, the implications of recipients' ability to go online and choose news content must have consequences.  The question in particular that is to be addressed is how bias in media literature can be avoided as well as political polarization in blog readers using certain carefully selected techniques within the blogs themselves.  The design will investigate how those with mid-range attitudes leaning neither to the left or the right can be swayed by the availability of both positive and negative comments.</p>
            <p>The intended theories which will be used include biased assimilation theory, social judgment theory, selective exposure theory and framing.  According to Iyengar (2010), “people are more likely to encounter attitude-congruent information as a result of their homogeneous social milieu rather than any active choices to avoid incongruent information,” which indicates that it is possible recipients are not aware of bias simply because they do not delve into anything which would oppose their realities (284).  In addition to selective exposure, social judgment theory infers that individuals perceive and evaluate an idea by comparing it with current attitudes or the attitudes around them (Hovland and Sherif: 1980).  While social judgment affects a person’s opinion through the human habit of comparing oneself to others, biased assimilation theory affirms that strongly opinionated people “are likely to examine relevant empirical evidence in a biased manner” (Lord, Ross, and Lepper: 1979, 2098).  This theory is monumental to this study in that it confirms the difficulty of removing bias in a polarized situation.  With roots in journal or diary-like posts on an individual’s personal website, blogs written by highly-opinionated people may be assessed by others and agreed with according to social judgment theory but rejected as “biased” by those maintaining a separate opinion.  </p>
<p>This research will help determine how recipients of news via blogs deal with distorting biases in news and blogs by examining at what point a person’s extremely polarized opinion of an issue can be changed or brought closer to a middle range.
