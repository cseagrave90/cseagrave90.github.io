            <p>This is my professional website I have designed myself, highlighting my knowledge of HTML and CSS.  On the tabs above, you will find my resume information as well as links to my published works and personal blog, WomanWaterWild.</p>

<p>If you’d like, take a look around.  I hope to update the website as often as possible and in the future, plan to post more links to whatever I find interesting out there in the journalism, marketing and public relations-related world.</p>
